To integrate a payment gateway in an Express.js application, follow these general steps:

1. Choose a Payment Gateway
Some popular payment gateways include:

Stripe: Widely used for web payments and subscriptions.
PayPal: Popular for its large user base.
Razorpay: Popular in India and other regions.
Square: A good alternative for POS systems and online payments.


2. Razorpay Integration
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Install the Razorpay Node SDK:


npm install express razorpay body-parser


Step 2: Configure Razorpay and Express Server



Testing
Razorpay also provides a test mode where you can use dummy cards like:
Card number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
Expiry: Any future date
CVV: Any 3-digit number
Considerations for Both Gateways
Security: Use HTTPS and secure your secret keys.
Webhooks: Both PayPal and Razorpay support webhooks to handle payment events asynchronously.
Error Handling: Ensure your application handles payment failures and exceptions properly.
Environment Variables: Store credentials (client_id, secret_key) in environment variables for security.
